In this zip folder, the ASM files one_1.c and one_2.c are respectively the solutions to task 1 and 2.

The internal commands are: cd, pwd ,and echo.
The external commands are: mkdir, rm, cat, ls ,and date. Their respective C programs are also contained here.
For the external programs:
- mkdir only takes name of directory as ./mkdir <name>.
- rm only takes name of file as ./rm <name>.
- cat only takes name of file as ./cat <name>.
- ls has its default version (./ls) and size version (./ls -s).
- date will straight away give the date by ./date .

Both ASM programs will take an input for the commands(name of commands) and execute it while taking the corresponding inputs(name of directory, string, etc.).
i.e. the inputs must be like:-
Enter the command to begin: echo hello
or, Enter the command to begin: cd
or, Enter the command to begin: date
or, Enter the command to begin: mkdir Dir1
