Folder named 'One' contains solutions for the first question and all its variants.
Both files for variant of program (a) are Async_One_a.c (for the Asynchronous variant) and One_a.c (for Synchronous Variant).
Both files for variant of program (b) are Async_One_b.c (for the Asynchronous variant) and One_b.c (for Synchronous Variant).
Both the programs One_a.c & One_b.c utilize pthread and semaphore header files.
