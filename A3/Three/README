In the module that follows, we add a read/write proc entry called task by pid. We can write the number into the proc entry for whichever process we wish to find the task struct of using its pid.

When we read the proc entry, the name of the process corresponding to the pid we entered will be displayed.\
IN this module, we have made use of the function pid_task defined in kernel/pid.c .
